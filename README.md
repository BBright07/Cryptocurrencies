# Cryptocurrencies
##Purpose
This cryptocurrency repository was created to help Martha, at Accountability Accounting, to invest in a cutting-edge financial system by integrating machine learning to analyze a cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The methods employed are under the umbrella of unsupervised learning to create clusters that group data based on the relationship between data points highlighted through their variance and covariance. Some of the algorithms used include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-Means. Three classes of cryptocurrencies were created and grouped into categories: PC 1, PC 2, PC 3.

##Summary
Overall, the capacity of machine learning in helping to find patterns in data was explored to develop further questions. In the case of cryptocurrencies, trade activity was thoroughly explored through an analysis of TotalCoinSupply, and TotalCoinsMined among other aspects of assessing the viability of crypto-investments.
